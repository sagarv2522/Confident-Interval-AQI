# Built a Confidence Interval of AQI Dataset ðŸŒ±

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is the Environmental Protection Agency's index for reporting air quality. A value close to 0 signals little to no public health concern, while higher values are associated with increased risk to public health. The United States is considering a new federal policy that would create a subsidy for renewable energy in states observing an average AQI of 10 or above.

You've just started your new role as a data analyst in the Strategy division of Ripple Renewable Energy (RRE). RRE operates in the following U.S. states: **California, Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas**. You've been tasked with constructing an analysis which identifies which of these states are most likely to be affected, should the new federal policy be enacted.

### Your manager has requested that you do the following for your analysis:

*  Provide a summary of the mean AQI for the states in which RRE operates.
*  Construct a boxplot visualization for AQI of these states using seaborn.
*  Evaluate which state(s) may be most affected by this policy, based on the data and your boxplot visualization.
*  Construct a confidence interval for the RRE state with the highest mean AQI.

## ðŸªœSteps for built Confidence Interval

4-step process in constructing a confidence interval:

*  Identify a sample statistic.
*  Choose a confidence level.
*  Find the margin of error.
*  Calculate the interval.
